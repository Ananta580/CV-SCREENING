# CV-SCREENING

This was our final year project , which was created to ease the process of CV-Screening by automatically selecting top candidates out of the number of Candidates applied for the job . We have used Python + Flask as backend and Angular as Frontend . The operation was quiet easy , just upload PDF of CV and get the TOP Candidates .


FOR BACKEND : We have used Flask,
FOR FRONTEND : We have used Angular 9 ,

YOU CAN EASILY FIND FRONTEND IN Web/Source folder.
YOU CAN RUN BACKEND BY Downloading depedencies , and app.py in main Folder .
